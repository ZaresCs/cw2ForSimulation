# cw2ForSimulation
This project contain two webpages, you can open each one at the first. And there is a button link to another webpage.
For the line chart, when you put mouse on the datapoint, the data will be showed. And if you click the Temperature or Crime_rate label, it will show or not show the line of it.
# result analysising
The project aims to detect the relationship between temperature and crime rates in London underground.
Refer to the Griffit W, Veitch R. (1971), we want to find that, when temperature is increasing the crime rates also increasing.
For analysising data, the outcome shows negative result. Not only crime rate will increase when temperature is increase, but also sometime it show negative trend.


First the result, these two data have some poteintial contect, like Griffit W, Veitch R. (1971) said. But it maybe cause to these two data do not have enough strong relationship to each other, the line chart trend can not show this.
